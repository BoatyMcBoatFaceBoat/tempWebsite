    <b><a href="https://www.electronjs.org">Electron</a></b> is a platform to build complete stand-alone applications.
    An advantage of Electron is that is allows for a user interface in terms of
    familiar languages such as HTML, CSS and Javascript.
    It is as if the application runs in its own browser.
    This makes it easy, also for people with little programming knowledge
    to build the user interface.
