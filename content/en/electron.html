    <h1>Electron</h1>
    <p>
      <b><a href="https://www.electronjs.org">Electron</a></b> is a platform 
      to build complete stand-alone applications.
      An advantage of Electron is that is allows for a user interface in terms of
      familiar languages such as HTML, CSS and Javascript.
      The application runs in its own browser.
      This makes it easy, 
      also for people with little programming experience,
      to build or adapt the user interface.
