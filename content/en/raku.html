    <p>
      <b><a rel="external" href="https://raku.org/">Raku</a></b> is a programming language
      designed on the basis of the experiences
      with predecessors like the highly popular <a rel="external" href="https://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> language.
      However, its author, <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall">Larry Wall</a>,
      did not design it as an extension. 
      Rather, he completely reenvisioned the language
      and made it more complete, more logical and more contemporary, 
      hoping to make it easier to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The language is ideally suited for complex analysis tasks.
      Because of Larry's special interest in natural language, there are excellent
      tools for parsing (i.e. automatic analysis of textual material).
      We use these tools in our spreadsheet tool set.
