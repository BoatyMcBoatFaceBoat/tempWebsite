    <b><a href="https://raku.org/">Raku</a></b> is designed on the basis of the experiences
    with predecessors like the highly popular <a href="https://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> language.
    However, its author, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall">Larry Wall</a>,
    did not design it as an extension. Rather, he completely reenvisioned the language
    and made it more complete and more logical, in the hope to make it easier to learn.
  </p>
  <p>
    The language is ideally suited for complex analysis tasks.
    Because of Larry's special interest in natural language, there are excellent
    tools for parsing (i.e. automatic analysis of textual material).
    We use these tools in our Excel tool set.
