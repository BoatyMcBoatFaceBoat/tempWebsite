          Our company hosts decades of experience in software engineering.
          In fact, you have almost certainly used software
          for which a member of our team was responsible.

          There exist thousands of programming languages and each week new ones are invented.
          If your organisation is highly invested in the consistent use of one programming framework
          it makes sense to try and use that for new developments.
          On the other hand, if you are in need of an application for your customers or your staff,
          and you have no strong reasons for picking a framework, we can help you pick a strategy.
          Do you want the application to be a web application?
          Do you want it to perform complex analyses?
          Does the analysis involve formal data
          or maybe running text in natural language?
          Does it need a variety of visual representations of data?
          By helping you answer these questions we can help you make the right choice.
