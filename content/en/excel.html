    <h1>Spreadsheets</h1>
    <p>
      If your company depends on the use of spreadsheets,
      then you are in trouble if they do not behave properly.
      Do your data and processes survive scrutiny by internal or external auditors?
      How do you know for certain that the resulting numbers are correct?
    </p>
    <p>
      If your organization encounters the limits of Excel,
      we may be able to use our tool set to help you out.
      Of course, you can consult your local Excel guru
      if you have trouble with formulas or VBA,
      but we can help if you run into manageability or consistency issues.
      We have tools to X-ray the whole set of Excel materials.
      You may find some flaws you were not even looking for.

          Spreadsheets are ideal to use as scrap paper for
          exploratory calculations or comparing scenarios.
          When spreadsheets act as a common document pool in an organization
          as part of the working process this can be a considerable risk,
          because anything from an unfortunate mouse movement or keystroke can wreak havoc.

          We offer a service to create a semantic analysis of collections of Excel (&#x2122;Microsoft)
          or other XML based spreadsheets.
        </p>
        <p>
          What we offer:
        <ul>
          <li>insight in Excel use, semantic analysis</li>
          <li>quality assurance and maintainability</li>
          <li>data stream optimization</li>
          <li>alternative solutions</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          We offer a software service by which your Excel materials are
          automatically semantically analyzed.
          The results are made available by means of an analysis workbench
          that offers visual representations of the findings of the semantic analysis.
          The workbench will indicate many aspects that disclose
          weaknesses in the data handling and calculations.
          This goes beyond finding and trapping common bugs in the creation of Excel sheets.
          The workbench provides innovative functionality to find weaknesses in the setup.
