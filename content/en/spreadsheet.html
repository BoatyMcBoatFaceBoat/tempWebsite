      <!-- If your company depends on the use of spreadsheets,
      then you are in trouble if they do not behave properly. -->
      Do your data and processes survive scrutiny by internal or external auditors?
      How do you know for certain that the resulting numbers are correct?

      Most organizations depend on spreadsheets.
      Microsofts Excel is often used.
      Spreadsheets easily lead to confusing results.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your organization encounters the limits of spreadsheets,
      we may be able to use our tool set to help you out.
    </p>
    <p>
      For complex formulas or macros (VBA in the case of Excel) you can call on us.
      Our main specialisation, however, is in with manageability or consistency issues,
      stemming from the structure and organisation of files.

      We have tools to X-ray the whole set of spreadsheet materials.
      You may find some flaws you were not even looking for.

          Spreadsheets are ideal to use as scrap paper for
          exploratory calculations or comparing scenarios.
          When spreadsheets act as a common document pool in an organization
          as part of the working process this can be a considerable risk,
          because anything from an unfortunate mouse movement or keystroke can wreak havoc.

          We offer a service to create a semantic analysis of collections of
          Excel (Microsoft&#x2122;)
          or other XML based spreadsheets.

        <ul>
          <li>insight in spreadsheet use, semantic analysis</li>

          We offer a software service for automatic semantic analysis of your Excel materials.
          The results are made available by means of an analysis workbench
          that offers visual representations of the findings of the semantic analysis.
          The workbench will indicate many aspects that disclose
          weaknesses in the data handling and calculations.
          This goes beyond finding and trapping common bugs in the creation of spreadsheet sheets.
          The workbench provides innovative functionality to find weaknesses in the setup.
