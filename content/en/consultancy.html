  <h1>Consultancy</h1>
  <p>
    We offer consultancy on site or remotely at a fixed hourly rate.
    We are happy to work with your team to
    answer hard questions on software use and development,
    on information streams,
    and other terrains where information technology affects
    the operation of your organisation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The central theme is <a href="model">modeling</a>.
    Creation of a model is almost the same as creating a solution to a complex challenge.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can work with your team or partners to realise a solution,
    also when new software is required 
    (see <a href="software">the text on programming</a>).

      An example of our consultancy work is a task we performed for an organisation
      that wanted to digitize their mail and other information streams.
      We interviewed the people with vested interest and used an existing modeling language
      to express and communicate our findings. One interesting finding was
      that there was no information flow between
      one particular staff member and the rest of the organisation.
      It did not take very long for the organisation to reconsider his employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not uncommon for managers to ask questions about the work processes.
      We have on several occasions helped managers to better understand
      and appreciate
      some of the internal workings of their organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work usually consists largely of developing a <a href="model">model</a>
      that describes all relevant relations.
      Sometimes the model is partially the result of a software-based analysis.
      Very often the result is an important step in creating a solution,
      be it in terms of software or 
      as a guiding document for management.
