    <h1>Modeling</h1>
    <p>
      Science models the world. The creation of a reliable model is essential
      in approaching complex problems.
      Our approach is rooted in mathematics.
      Mathematics invents axioms and rules, but even more importantly a language
      to discuss its elements.
      A well chosen and descriptive language is almost the same as a solution to your problem.

          We do not have to do this from scratch.
          There exist a number of modeling frameworks,
          that help us express relationships.
          These usually come with graphics,
          so that the knowledge contained in the model can be visualized for its audience
          in easily understandable diagrams.
          Examples of such frameworks:
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">UML</a>
          is often used for modeling IT-related issues.
          We find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDEF0">IDEF0</a>,
          though limited with respect to UML,
          is excellent for things like information flows.
          At times we have developed problem oriented frameworks
          to address specific questions.

          Mathematics is rigourous in the sense that theorems have irrefutable proofs.
          In the same way, we aim for models that we can trust to be complete.
