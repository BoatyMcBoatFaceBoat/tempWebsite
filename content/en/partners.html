      We are looking for partners in a number of areas.
      We would like to team with Excel experts, so that

      knowledge on formulas, pivoting, array formulas, VBA and other
      spreadsheet issues, many users struggle with.
      We can help with the issues concerning maintainability,
      hart to find anomalies and reliability.
